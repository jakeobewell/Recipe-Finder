# ajax-project

A solo project single page application that uses AJAX to request data from an API. The user can enter search parameters for cooking recipes and recieve a list of recipes that can be favorited for later use. 

Try it here: [Recipe-Finder](https://jakeobewell.github.io/ajax-project/)

Through building this application, I learned how to effectively use AJAX and furthered my knowledge in rendering data on a single page application using the DOM.

I plan on adding a feature to request more recipes per entry and more search parameters. At the time of building this application, my API key had a limited amount of requests made and search features.
